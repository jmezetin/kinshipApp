<p>We are all experiencing a new way of life. We are hoping it is temporary, but we don't know exactly when this will end. 
In the meantime, please do all you can to help globally. Even if there are few or no reported cases where you live, please follow the safety guidelines that are being given. 
Limit your in-person contact with others and do self quarantine as much as possible. Wash hands often and eat as healthfully as you can to prevent any illnesses that might be around during this season. Together we can come out of this crisis much stronger. 
</p>
<p>
During this time, find new ways of keeping busy and helping others. Check on friends and loved ones and see if there is anything
 that is needed. Go to the Kinship website and check out our resources. There are tons of good videos 
 and articles to read and share with friends, family and pastors. Although the General Conference in Indianpolis has been postponed, 
 we want to do some aggressive outreach programs to Adventist pastors and educators to invite them to learn more about SDA Kinship 
 and our community of current and former Seventh-day Adventists who identify as LGBTQIA+. </p>
 
 <p>SDA Kinship's primary mission remains to promote the well-being/wellness of our members,
      as well as and all the LGBTQ+ individuals who have a connection to Adventism. 
      As Vice President for SDA Kinship, I am here for you during this crisis and I am available via social media 
      and email to chat with you and pray for you and encourage you in whatever areas you need. 
      </p>
      
      <p>After cleaning your closets and organizing your digital photo albums and completing the 
          puzzle on the dining room table, please update your profile and contact info in the member database.
           Go to www.sdakinship.org/login and login. If you forgot your username or password the system can help 
           you retrieve and reset those. If you run into a problem, let me know and I will be happy to assist you.

<h5><span style="color: #262262; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: HELVETICA;"><strong>Church Relations Update</strong></span></h5>
<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 22px;">
<p><img style="float: right;" src="images/eNews/20200407/gc.jpg" alt="gc 96962777 s" />
<p>When Seventh-day Adventist Kinship was founded more than 40 years ago, we could never have imagined the progress recently realized by the LGBTQI community. We are still seeing advances in cultural, legal, and personal acceptance in most societies.</p>
<p>Sadly and ironically, religious prejudice and intolerance is one of the last barriers we have to overcome. We are happy to report that the Kinship Advisory Council, made up of friends and allies throughout North America, is working to increase the 
    awareness of Adventist members and congregations about the dignity and equality owed to all members of the LBGTQI community and their families. The Advisory includes pastors, professors, administrators, and lay members and is committed to making equality 
    in the Adventist Church a reality. It has now been meeting annually for the last twenty years. The most recent meeting has sent recommendations to the Kinship Board for ways to engage the denomination in the coming year, along with a report of how 
    members of the Advisory have been involved in supporting Kinship during the past year. Members of the Advisory were given a copy of the book, <a href="http://www.unclobber.com"><i>Unclobber</i></a>, by Colby Martin.</p>
<p>We see local churches and communities as having the greatest potential for improving the perception of Kinship among the Adventist population. Some local congregations have been 
    consciously working toward inclusion and acceptance for people of all ethnicities, educational backgrounds, sexual orientations, and religious traditions. 
    Visit 
    <a href="AdventistChurchWelcomingStatements.org">AdventistChurchWelcomingStatements.org</a> to see if there is a welcoming congregation near you. If not, 
    perhaps you can work with someone to help turn your church into a place where all are welcome.</p>
<p>The Advisory is committed to making the church more inclusive. The Advisory is here to join us in our journey.</p>

<h5><span style="color: #262262; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: HELVETICA;"><strong>LET'S BE TENACIOUS</strong></span><span style="font-family: HELVETICA; line-height: 22px;"></span><span style="font-family: helvetica; line-height: 22px;"></span></span></h5>

<p><img style="float: right;" src="images/eNews/20200407/gc.jpg" alt="gc 96962777 s" />
<p>Today's world is a bit chaotic! A few weeks ago our political world was filled with various discussions, opinions, needs, and desires and gatherings. 
    Our physical world was moving out of wintertime and looking forward to springtime with less snow, tornadoes and rain, and more wildflowers and wonderful sunsets. 
    Suitcases and hiking backpacks were coming out of their closets getting ready for fun trips, looking forward to cruises, vacations, school proms and graduations, and spring break.</p>

<p>THEN <i>suddenly</i> our world changed! Our plans were dampened and some were washed away. 
    THE <i>virus</i>> arrived and, with it, major changes to our plans, our lives, and our immediate futures.</p>

<p>So what? We can overcome it! God has given each of us the ability to be tenacious, to be strong and accepting of our temporary "new" world.</span></p>

<p>One day our gay son Aric discovered a tree near our lakeside cabin in the California High Sierras. 
    This 80-feet tall pine tree stood boldly upright on a 20-foot tall granite ledge. It only had two roots to feed it and hold it upright. 
    One root grew toward the mountain into rich soil and rocks. The second root snaked its way back and forth, over and down the face of the ledge. 
    It was over 30 feet long, almost 2 feet in diameter, and at its far end it dropped straight down about 5 feet into its rich soil.</p>

<p>Aric came back to the cabin and said, "Mom and Dad, I've got something neat to show you." And he drove us back over to "the tree." We walked up and studied "the tree." 
    He and I climbed up the ledge and found the back good root, then we came back to the front and examined the bold exploring root. Wow, it had worked hard to find food for its tree!</p>

    <p>Aric said, "Mom and Dad, this is my tenacious tree. It reflects my life and our family life!"</p>

<p>He was correct. As I've studied the word tenacious, I found that it fit our family's needs. And today it also fits our Kinship Family & Friends' needs.</p>

<p>Tenacious can mean "holding firmly" like that root held its tree firmly to the ground and granite ledge. As Kinship members and family and friends members,
     we can also purposely hold firmly to each other, to support each other, to even be roots of emotional and loving support to each other and keep ourselves and our families upright and firm.</p>

<p>Tenacious can also mean being stubborn and persistent. Again, I'm sure that tenacious root was stubborn and persistent when the strong 
    winds tried to blow it's tree over, tried to end it's life; but the root wouldn't let go - it hung on! Sometimes when the winds of hate and misunderstanding try and blow us over, insult our members and bruise our families, we can also support each other and not let go either.</p>

<p>Another tenacious definition reflects on being strongly cohesive or adhesive. Through tenacity we can stick together and support each other. Don't give up and let anyone or anything pry you away from your family and friends. Sadly, we still have many folks that honestly don't understand. They still believe what they've been incorrectly taught, and only our loving tenacity can start to change their feelings and beliefs.</p>

<p>Finally, tenacity is also being retentive: the ability to retain or remember. So as you think about your own lives, your own families, your own life experiences, search out the positive and fun memories, recall and share those tenacious memories. They are great tools and emotional triggers to make a moment or maybe a day brighter and survivable.</p>

<p>Thanks, Aric, for finding your tenacious tree. Your thoughts and feelings about it were right on. Today our family memorial plaque for Aric still sits below that tenacious root. If you ever visit the June Lake Loop, off of highway 395 in Mono County, let us know and we'll tell you how to find the tenacious tree.</p>
<p>Blessings to all, and happy tenacity!</p>
